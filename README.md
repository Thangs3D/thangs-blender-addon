### Continue on Thangs.com

Once the Thangs Blender Addon has found some models for you, you can either click on the [Thangs](https://thangs.com?utm_source=blender_github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=blender_github) icon
at the top-right of the addon to explore the same search on the Thangs website, or you can click on any of the models themselves to go to
the model directly, whether it's on Thangs or one of the sites that Thangs indexes.
