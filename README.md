### Upload your work to Thangs

[Thangs.com](https://thangs.com) is a 3D platform for discovering, sharing, and collaborating with other 3D creators and artists.
The Thangs platform has served more than eleven million users and averages more than a search per second, making it a great destination
to share your work.

This addon lets you upload your Blender model to Thangs without leaving Blender.  Take advantage of 
Thangs's 3D version control system to keep track of the history of your model over time.

Models are uploaded privately by default, but can be publicly shared if so desired.
