# Thangs-Blender-Addon

## Thangs' Add-on for Blender

Thangs-Blender-Addon is an addition to the Blender model sites and Blender catalogs you already use! Thangs-Blender-Addon is a [Blender](http://www.blender.org) Add-on to search, preview, and download [Thangs](https://thangs.com?utm_source=blender_github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=blender_github)' wide variety/quantity of compatible free blender models.

Thangs-Blender-Addon is an open-source community-developed project using the Thangs.com API.

## Features

Thangs-Blender-Addon is an integrated search engine for [Blender](http://www.blender.org) that allows you to search for free prebuilt models/meshes so that you can save time in your creative workflow process. You can then navigate to [Thangs](https://thangs.com?utm_source=blender_github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=blender_github) and import your desired model. The viewport can display previews of all the models found on Thangs in the add-on. The addon is meant to help find your desired meshes or models as fast as possible - while being a built in Blender model site :)
